        <h2>What is {{ request.site.name }}?</h2>
        <p>{{ request.site.name }} is a way to waste spammers' time. If you get a spam
        email, simply forward it to <strong>sp@mnesty.com</strong>,
        and {{ request.site.name }} will strip your email address, pretend it's a real
        person and reply to the email. Just remember to strip out any personal
        information from the body of the email, as it will be used so the reply looks
        more legitimate.</p>

        <p>That way, the spammer will start talking to a bot, and hopefully waste some
        time there instead of spending it on a real victim. Meanwhile,
        {{ request.site.name }} will send you an email with a link to the conversation,
        so you can watch it unfold live!</p>
